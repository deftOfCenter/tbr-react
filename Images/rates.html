		<h2 id="PointSystem">The Point System</h2>
		<p>
			At the Breathing Room, we offer many different types of classes, from one-on-one instuction to group classes.  Consequently, we created a points system that can be used towards any class we offer.  Each type of class is worth a corresponding number of points so, we encourage you to branch out into any of our various services.  The point value of each class is as follows:

Points can be used for almost any type of education from a Pilates private to a mat class.  So, brush up with an instructor on that sticky move in a private, check out our reformer classes, or schedule a semi-private with a friend, you won't regret it!
			<br />
			Point bundles are also available for couples and businesses, call for more info.
